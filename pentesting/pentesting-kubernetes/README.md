# Pentesting Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Basics

If you don't know anything about Kubernetes this is a **good start**. Read it to learn about the **architecture, components and basic actions** in Kubernetes:

- [kubernetes-basics.md](kubernetes-basics.md)

## Pentesting Kubernetes

### From the Outside

There are several possible **Kubernetes services that you could find exposed** on the Internet (or inside internal networks). If you find them you know there is Kubernetes environment in there.

Depending on the configuration and your privileges you might be able to abuse that environment, for more information:

- [pentesting-kubernetes-from-the-outside.md](pentesting-kubernetes-from-the-outside.md)

### Enumeration inside a Pod

If you manage to **compromise a Pod** read the following page to learn how to enumerate and try to **escalate privileges/escape**:

- [attacking-kubernetes-from-inside-a-pod.md](attacking-kubernetes-from-inside-a-pod.md)

### Enumerating Kubernetes with Credentials

You might have managed to compromise **user credentials, a user token or some service account toke**n. You can use it to talk to the Kubernetes API service and try to **enumerate it to learn more** about it:

- [enumeration-from-a-pod.md](enumeration-from-a-pod.md)

Another important details about enumeration and Kubernetes permissions abuse is the **Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. If you want to abuse permissions, you first should read about it here:

- [kubernetes-role-based-access-control-rbac.md](kubernetes-role-based-access-control-rbac.md)

#### Knowing about RBAC and having enumerated the environment you can now try to abuse the permissions with:
